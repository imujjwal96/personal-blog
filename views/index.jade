            h2 Hello, I'm Ujjwal Bhardwaj
            p
                | I am a Software Development Engineer currently working at Amazon. Before now, I worked at Amazon Web
                | Services, as a Big Data Cloud Support Associate, after completing bachelor's degree (B.Tech. in Computer
                | Science) in 2018. I have experience in AWS Solutions Architecture and hold the following certifications
            ul
                li AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate
                li AWS Certified SysOps Administrator - Associate
                li AWS Certified Developer Associate
            p
                | I am open source enthusiast and a consistent advocate of language agnostic Software Development. I have
                | contributed to open source projects with varying technology stacks. Most notably, I have added new
                | features and fixed bug in the Amazon SageMaker Python SDK. It is a high level open source library for
                | training and deploying machine-learned models on Amazon SageMaker. I participated in and successfully
                | cleared Google Summer of Code under the mentoring organization FOSSASIA. I contributed in the development
                | of a CI/CD project that continuously generates and deploy documentation on every commit to Github
                | repositories. You can find details around the project here.
            p
                | In my spare time, I love playing video games on my PlayStation, and occasionally stream on Twitch. I also
                | enjoy reading fiction novels, watching documentaries, and surfing through 9Gag for memes.
            p
                | I have been building and shipping web applications for the past four years. Alongside my studies, I have
                | worked as a freelance developer and have developed web and mobile applications.
            p
                | My vision for this blog is to help new developers and dev ops engineers understand Big Data and
                | Machine Learning services provided by AWS and build efficient DevOps solutions. I believe that learning
                | from an example is much easier. I will also be targeting advanced developers with a few advanced tips
                | and tricks. I share my experiences around the new technologies that I learn and I hope you enjoy
                | reading them! My opinions are my own and they do not represent my current of any of my previous
                | employers.
            p
                | I'll happily provide consultation on the architecture of AWS services (mainly around BigData
                | and Machine Learning), speak at your event, or provide mentorship for your open source projects. Feel
                | free to email me with details!
